# Introduction

## Why Consider European Cloud Providers?

In a cloud landscape dominated by established giants like AWS and Azure, it may seem counterintuitive to explore less mature European cloud providers such as OVH Cloud. However, there are compelling reasons to do so. Data sovereignty, compliance with strict EU regulations (like GDPR), and a desire to reduce dependency on US-based tech companies are driving many organizations to consider European alternatives. Additionally, supporting local providers can foster competition, innovation, and potentially more favorable pricing or support for European customers.

## What is a Production-Ready Kubernetes Cluster?

A "production-ready" Kubernetes cluster is more than just a working installation. It is a robust, secure, and scalable environment that can reliably run business-critical workloads. Key characteristics include:
- High availability and fault tolerance
- Secure networking (private clusters, network policies)
- Automated scaling (horizontal pod autoscaling, cluster autoscaler)
- Integrated monitoring and logging
- Role-based access control (RBAC) and identity integration
- Automated backups and disaster recovery
- Regular updates and patch management
- Compliance with organizational and regulatory requirements

A production-ready cluster is designed to minimize downtime, protect sensitive data, and support the needs of both developers and operations teams.

## Measuring Developer Experience and Cost

In this blog post, we will compare OVH Cloud, Azure AKS, and AWS EKS by measuring how quickly each provider can deliver a ready-to-use managed Kubernetes cluster. Speed of deployment is crucial: the faster a cluster is provisioned, the sooner developers can start building and deploying applications. We will also examine whether developers can work on an OVH managed cluster without being impacted by performance or feature gaps, and whether OVH offers a cost advantage compared to the more established providers. Our goal is to provide practical insights into whether OVH Cloud is a viable and affordable alternative for production workloads in the European context.
